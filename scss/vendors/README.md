# Vendors

The `sass/vendors/` folder gathers all Sass source files from external libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap, jQueyUI and so on.
Putting those aside in the same folder helps you later to override a specific section of a vendor or to completely rebuild a new custom theme based on vendor source files to be used across your application.

This architecture comes with two vendors example: **Bootstrap v5.3.2** and **OwlCarousel2.3.4**
