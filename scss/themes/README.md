# Themes

The `themes/` folder holds styles that describe how modules or layouts might look in different themes.
This folder is essentially used within large sites and applications. It is likely to be non-existent on many projects.
Separating the theme out into its own set of styles allows for those styles to be easily redefined for alternate themes.
